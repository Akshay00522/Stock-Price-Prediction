# Stock-Price-Prediction
Predict stock prices using real-time data, ML models, and beautiful Indian-style bar graphs ‚Äî built in Python with zero deep learning dependencies!
# üìà Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning (Random Forest)

This project predicts stock prices using real-time historical data and the **Random Forest Regressor** model ‚Äî with clean visualizations, Indian currency formatting (Lakhs/Crores), and a complete CSV export of results.

## üîç Problem Statement

Stock market prices are volatile and difficult to predict using traditional methods. Investors struggle to make informed decisions due to lack of accurate, automated forecasting tools.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Overview

We used **machine learning algorithms** to predict stock prices using historical features like:
- Opening, High, Low, Volume
- Moving Averages (10-day, 50-day)
- Price Volatility

This project uses **real-time data from Yahoo Finance**, trains a model, and visualizes actual vs predicted prices using bar graphs (in ‚Çπ Lakhs/Crores).
